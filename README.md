# oak_d_pcl_measurement

This repo contains code capable of generating a point cloud measurement from OAK-D camera.
It requires basic OAK-D setup to be made on the machine and `depthai` and `depthai-python` libraries to be installed.
For that, follow the instructions on: https://app.tettra.co/teams/theia/pages/oak-d-setup

To finalize the setup, install the requirements **inside** the OAK-d `venv`, created during the setup: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
